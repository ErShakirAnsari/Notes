To share file, You can use Apps like ES File Explorer

The SFTP option in ES File Explorer lets you share files between Devices.

Some Short Notes of its usage

Connect Your Android Phone to the Raspberry Pi Wi-Fi

Open ES File Explorer
Select Menu
Select Network
Select FTP
Select New
Select SFTP
Then in the window that opens

In Server put IP Address of your Raspberry PI (192.168.0.1 for example)
Leave Port as 22
In Username enter your RaspberryPi Login username
In Password enter your RaspberryPi login password
Leave Encoding as auto
In Display As choose any name you wish
Press OK
Now You should be able to access the files in RaspberryPi

NOTE:

You can use ES file Explore even if you just normally connect Raspberry Pi to your Android Mobile Hotspot. All that matters is Android Phone and RaspberryPi should be on same netwrok.
Make sure SSH is enabled and installed in RaspberyrPI to use this option. To know about ssh check here:
